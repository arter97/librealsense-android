[Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0] 
Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0 is a cross-platform library for Intel® RealSense™ depth cameras (D400 series and the SR300). 
The SDK allows depth and color streaming, and provides intrinsic and extrinsic calibration information. The library also offers synthetic streams (pointcloud, depth aligned to color and vise-versa), and a built-in support for record and playback of streaming sessions.
Developer kits containing the necessary hardware to use this library are available for purchase at www.realsense.intel.com/buy. Information about the Intel® RealSense™ technology at www.realsense.intel.com
